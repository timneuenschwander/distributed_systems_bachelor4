Assignment 4 Tim Neuenschwander

Code for RPI is in the Assignment4.py file.

Comments:

Herewith I want to declare that I worked together with/talked with Alain (for the code in general) and indirectly received help from Martin (for the 12 degree calculation). 

Furthermore, the feedback I have for you is similar to the older ones. The task is cool, you guys are cool and the course is cool, but the effort reflects an 8 credits course at HSG and it makes it difficult to get all the work done next to these assignments.
