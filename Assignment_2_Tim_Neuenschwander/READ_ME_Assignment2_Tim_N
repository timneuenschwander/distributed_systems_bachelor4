1.1

LoRa --> Physical Layer --> Physical + Datalink

LoRa describes the communication technology (wireless technology), which requires a very small 
amount of energy (low powered senders), but enables long distance transmission of small data 
packages (0.3. kbps to 5.5 kbps). LoRa is always used for the communication betweenLoRa sensors 
(nodes) and LoRa Gateways(that are connected with the LoRa-Server).

LoRaWAN --> MAC Layer + Application Layer --> Transport + Network

LoRaWan is the whole setup are LoRa compatible devices. It is the network structure and 
communication system thatconnects the individual components.

LoRa Edge

LoRa Edge (LR1110) is an "ultra-low power platform that integrates a long range LoRa transceiver, 
multi-constellation scanner and passive Wi-Fi AP MAC address scanner targeting asset management applications".

"The LR1110 solution utilizes Semtechâ€™s LoRa Cloud geolocation capabilities, to significantly reduce power 
consumption by determining asset location in a Cloud-based solver."

1.2

No. The data that gateways receive from individual end notes are transmitted to the network server,
 then to the application server and then to the user. Plus there are two decription processes between the
gateway and the end user.

Process:

An endnote broadcasts its data to every gateway within reaching distance. These gateways then forward the data to 
the network server, which determines the gateway with the best reception. After that the network server sends the data
to the application server, which ultimately provides the data to the end user (visualisation of the data).

1.3

Encryption:

There are two keys associated with the transmitted data. The "Network Session Key" (Message Integrity and MAC commands) 
and the "Application Session Key" (Payload Encryption and Decryption). Hence a data packet must be encrypted at these two servers,
in order to be accessible for the end user.

1.4

The spreading factor of the received packets is 7 nd the bandwith is 125 kHz.
The printed output looks like this: "data_rate: SF7BW125".

The RSSI is the received signal strength indicator. Normally, RSSIs are distributed within the range -30dB to -90dB 
When looking at the output of mqtt.py the RSSI is always around -90dB.

1.5

Given the values SF 7 and BW 125kHZ I made the following conclusions:
- The low SF of 7 indicates a short distance between the sensor and the gateway. The transmission is direct and clear.
- The high BW of 125kHZ means that the throughput is high and the disturbance or disruption is low. Therefore the 
distance between the sensor and the gateway is rather small.
